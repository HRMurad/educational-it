### 1. User Authentication

- **Description:** Tech Event provides robust user authentication features. Users can create accounts using their email and password, sign in with their credentials, or conveniently use their Google accounts for authentication. Firebase Authentication ensures the security of user data.

### 2. Real-time User State Management

- **Description:** The application manages user states in real-time using the `onAuthStateChanged` hook. This means that the user interface updates automatically based on whether the user is authenticated or not, enhancing user engagement and personalization.

### 3. User Profile Customization

- **Description:** Users have the ability to customize their profiles. They can update their display names and profile pictures through the "update profile" feature, adding a layer of uniqueness to their profiles and interactions within the app.

### 4. Google Sign-In Integration

- **Description:** Tech Event integrates Google Sign-In as an authentication method. This feature offers users the convenience of signing in with their Google accounts, reducing the barrier to entry for new users and improving the overall user experience.

### 5. Loading State Management

- **Description:** The application efficiently manages loading states with the `loading` state variable. This ensures that users receive feedback about ongoing processes, such as account creation, sign-in, or profile updates. Loading indicators keep users informed and engaged during these operations.
